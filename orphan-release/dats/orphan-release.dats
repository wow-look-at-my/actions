# orphan-release.sh publishes two tags: a numbered one that is immutable and
# unique to the run, and #latest, a pointer every concurrent release moves.
# GitHub applies one push in one ref transaction, so while both refs travelled
# together, a run that lost the race for #latest had its whole push rejected --
# taking down the numbered tag, which was never contested. The release then had
# no tag at all, and callers papered over it by repeating the step.
#
# A real race is not reproducible on demand. The remote refuses the pointer
# instead: a pre-receive hook that rejects #latest stands in for losing the
# race, and the question is only what happens to the OTHER ref in the same
# push. Run this suite against the one-push version and the two
# NUMBERED_TAG_PUBLISHED cases fail.
#
# Every push goes to a local bare repository, so this needs no token and no
# network.
