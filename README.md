# GitHub Actions

Reusable GitHub Actions.

## Building

Every node action builds with [ts0](https://github.com/wow-look-at-my/ts0), from the `ts0.json` in its directory: `cd <action> && just build`. Get ts0 with `curl -fsSL https://apt.pazer.build/ts0/install.sh | sudo sh && sudo apt-get install ts0`. CI downloads it from buildhost instead.

ts0 supplies the compiler, the bundler and `@types/node`, so an action's `package.json` lists only what it imports at run time. `ts0 test` type-checks the project and runs its test files. `dist/` is not committed. CI builds it before it cuts a release tag.

  with:
    branch: # Branch name to block
```

### [Cache Cleanup](cache-cleanup/)

```yml
# Delete this run's cache hand-offs and sweep aged ones left by crashed runs (housekeeping for cache-upload/cache-download).
- uses: wow-look-at-my/actions@cache-cleanup#latest
```

### [Cache Download](cache-download/)

```yml
# Restore files handed off by cache-upload earlier in the same workflow run (artifact-free replacement for actions/download-artifact).

```

### [Cache rg](cache-rg/)

```yml
# Install ripgrep from apt with the .deb cached between runs (ubuntu-latest only).

### [Cloudflare Pages](cloudflare-pages/)

```yml
# Publish a directory to Cloudflare Pages by direct upload (wrangler) - no Actions artifacts, no Cloudflare git integration.

## Reusable Workflows

### Publish to GHCR

```yml
jobs:
  publish-ghcr:
    uses: wow-look-at-my/actions/.github/workflows/publish-ghcr.yml@master
```

Pass the secret to opt in. A push then notifies docker-updater immediately. A private image does not emit a GitHub package webhook. This is recommended there. The URL defaults to `https://docker-updater-hook.pazer.io/`:

```yml
jobs:
  publish-ghcr:
    uses: wow-look-at-my/actions/.github/workflows/publish-ghcr.yml@master
    secrets:
      updater-webhook-secret: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_UPDATER_WEBHOOK_SECRET }}
```

Set `DOCKER_UPDATER_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (same value as docker-updater's `DOCKER_UPDATER_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`) at the org level. A caller that omits the secret keeps the behavior it has today.
