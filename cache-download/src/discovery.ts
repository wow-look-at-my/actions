// Download-only module (NOT one of the byte-identical files shared with
// cache-upload): nameless discovery — turning "the hand-offs this run
// saved" into a single unambiguous pick, or a loud refusal.
//
// The pinned @actions/cache 5.2.0 twirp client exposes no list RPC (only
// CreateCacheEntry / FinalizeCacheEntryUpload / GetCacheEntryDownloadURL),
// so listing uses the DOCUMENTED public REST API cache-cleanup already
// relies on: GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/caches with `key` as a
// prefix ("An explicit key or prefix for identifying the cache"). That
// endpoint needs a github-token with `actions: read`; the twirp
// ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN cannot call it. When no usable token is available
// the ambiguity check degrades to a warning and the newest run-scoped entry
// is restored — which is why multi-producer runs must keep explicit names
// (see action.yml / README).
