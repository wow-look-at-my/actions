Pass the secret to opt in. A push then notifies docker-updater immediately. A private image does not emit a GitHub package webhook. This is recommended there. The URL defaults to `https://docker-updater-hook.pazer.io/`:

```yml
jobs:
  publish-ghcr:
    uses: wow-look-at-my/actions/.github/workflows/publish-ghcr.yml@master
    secrets:
      updater-webhook-secret: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_UPDATER_WEBHOOK_SECRET }}
```

Set `DOCKER_UPDATER_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (same value as docker-updater's `DOCKER_UPDATER_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`) at the org level. A caller that omits the secret keeps the behavior it has today.
